<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "{{ name }}" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the key bindings your extension provides. For example:
-->

**{{ name }}** provides key bindings from **Another Editor**, helping you feel right at home in Nova.

## Details

<!--
ðŸŽˆ To help users get a feel for how bindings provided by your extension will work in practice, consider listing them:
-->

| Menu Item              | Binding     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| **Command Palette...** | `Shift-âŒ˜-P` |
| **Open Quickly...**    | `âŒ˜-P`       |
| ...                    |             |

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension provides too many bindings to list, that's okay! Instead, consider providing an overview of what users might expect to find:
-->

{{ name }} offers keyboard bindings in the following categories:

- Lorem
- Ipsum
- Dolor
- Sit
- Amet

<!--
ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!

P.S. If you'd like, you can remove these comments before submitting your extension ðŸ˜‰
